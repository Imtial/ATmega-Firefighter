# ATmega FireFighter

This is an ATmega32-based project done as the term project of CSE 316: Microcontrollers, Microprocessors and Embedded Systems sessional course. The system we developed can search for fire in its surveillance area. If it finds any fire incident it can alert the place owner by sending SMS and extinguish the fire by throwing fire directly to the source.
